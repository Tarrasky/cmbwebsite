# cmbwebsite

This is my first project, I'm learning html/css for a month now and I decided to make a webpage to my friend's discord for practice.

Feel free to look and change anything, I'm using all images for educational purpose so please don't sue me >w<

This webpage will have the purpose to help the Osu! brazilian mapping community, adding foruns and links for tutorials of mapping and helping boards for new mappers or mapping projects.

Thank you <3 Discord: Tarrasky#3344
